//Choosing a Hash Function
//The choice of hash function depends on the data type of the key.If key is an integer, then the simplest 
//hash function is to return the key modulo to the size of the array.There are circumstances when this function is not recommended
//such as when the keys all end in 0 and the array size is 10.This is one reason the array size should alwys be a prome number, such as 137.
//Also if the keys are random integers, then hash function should more evenly distributed the keys.
//This type of hashing is known as modular hashing

//Choosing Hash Function keys
//In many applications, the keys are strings.Choosing a hash function to work with string keys to be more difficult and should be chosen carefully


//Simplest Hash Function
//A simple hash function is to sum ASCII value of the letters in the key.
//The value is then that sum modulo to the size of the array.

//If you pay close attention to the output you will see not all the names in the orignal array of names are displayed
//Letâ€™s investigate further by adding a console() statement to the simpleHash() function:
//The problem is now ther's two key in the hash have same key 730 "clayton" and "raymond"
//Let's create a better hash function to avoid collision between keys


//A better hash function
//To avoid collisions, you first need to maake sure that the array you are using for the hashtable is sized to a prime number.
//This is necessary due to modular airthmetic in computing the key.
//The size of the array needs to be greater than 100 in order to more
//evenly disperse the keys in the table.


//After properly sizing the hash table, the next step to avoiding hashing collision is to compute 
//a better hash value
